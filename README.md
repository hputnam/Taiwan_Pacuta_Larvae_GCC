This project examines gene expression of _Pocillopora acuta_ larvae exposed to ambient temperature and pCO2 or high temperature and pCO2. Samples were collected from 3 replicate groups of larvae per treatment after exposure for 9 days. RNA extracted from the samples was prepped using Illumina TruSeq Sample Prep v2 Guide and sequenced 2x100bp on the Illumina GAIIx.
